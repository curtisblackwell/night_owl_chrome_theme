# How to Install
For now, you'll have to do things manually. I'll have this up on the Chrome Webstore soon/eventually.

1. Download and unzip files.
2. Go to [Extensions](chrome://chrome/extensions/) in Chrome.
3. Click the **Developer mode** checkbox.
4. Click the **Pack extension…** button.
5. Click the **Browse…** button next to **Extension root directory** and choose the `night_owl` folder.
6. Click **Pack Extension**.
7. Drag the newly created `night_owl.crx` (should be next to the `night_owl` folder) into your Chrome window and click **Add** when the prompt appears.
